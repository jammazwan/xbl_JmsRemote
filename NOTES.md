### JmsRemote NOTES:

This project assumes you have already set up a remote activemq. It is wired specifically to [this setup](https://github.com/jammazwan/jammazwan.docker), which can be done very quickly. But any activemq setup probably works fine.

### To Run

Run XblTest.

### Local alternatives?

If you want to run activemq inside your local vm see [this project](https://github.com/jammazwan/xbk_JmsLocal) for setup. It is identical to this one, excepting the pom.xml and activemq.xml.
